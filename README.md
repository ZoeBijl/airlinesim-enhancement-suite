Marcipanas wrote [a guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hzMHb3hTBXSZNtuDKoBuvx1HP9CgB7wVYR59yDYympg/) on how to use the extension’s features.

## Installation

Supported platforms: chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc).
This guide is based on [racsofp’s guide](https://forums.airlinesim.aero/t/manual-installation-of-the-ase-airlinesim-enhancement-suite-chrome-extension/24671).

1. Download the current version from the [releases](https://github.com/ZoeBijl/airlinesim-enhancement-suite/releases) site.
   The file you look for has the format AES.vX.X.X.zip where the _X_ is replaced with numbers. Example: AES.v0.6.8.zip
2. Unzip it.
3. Open your browser and go the expansion page.
    - Chrome: [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
    - Edge: [edge://extensions](edge://extensions)
4. In the upper right corner is a slide bar that says _enable developer_. Enable it.
5. In the upper left should be a button that says _Load unpacked_. Click it.
6. Find the folder (unziped!) from part 2 and select it.

The extensions should be added, and you can enable it.

### Please note
Until AES is available on the chrome web store, this is a methode to install it directly.

## History

Marcipanas is the original developer of this extension.
It seems they ceased development sometime in 2020.
The community has published some updates in the meantime but no continued development has happened since.
